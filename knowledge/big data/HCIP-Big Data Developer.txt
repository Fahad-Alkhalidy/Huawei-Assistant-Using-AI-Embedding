HCIP-Big Data Developer

Type

Cloud Platform & Cloud Services (Big Data)

Capabilities to be Certified

With HCIP-Big Data Developer V2.0 certification, you will be able to use Huawei MRS or open-source Hadoop platform components to develop applications in different service scenarios, including offline batch processing, real-time retrieval, real-time stream, and converged data warehouse scenarios. In addition, you will have E2E big data solution development capabilities, and are competent for big data application development positions.

Knowledge to Learn

The HCIP-Big Data Developer V2.0 certification courses include the general guide to big data application development, mainstream big data technologies, big data application development process, and big data scenario-based solutions (offline batch processing, real-time retrieval, real-time stream processing, and converged data warehouse). The courses provide rich in-class experiments and scenario-based case practices to improve trainees' practical capabilities and promote the cultivation of senior development engineers in the big data industry. Compared with V1.0, HCIP-Big Data Developer V2.0 adds four scenario-based practical drills, new big data application development technologies, and DWS.

Objectives

● Master the changes and technology trends of the big data industry
● Enable trainees to master the practice of offline batch processing scenario-based big data development through scenario-based project practice.
● Enable trainees to master real-time retrieval scenario-based big data development practices through scenario-based project practice.
● Enable trainees to master real-time stream processing scenario-based big data development practices through scenario-based project practice.
● Master the database routine management methods based on DWS
